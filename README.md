# LatticeJSON

LatticeJSON is a generic lattice file format based on JSON. As different lattice files have program-specific elements and attributes a 1:1 translation between them is not always possible. A 1:1 mapping can be achieved by defining restricted versions of common latticefile formats, where only generic elements are allowed. Than lattice files in different formats can be generated from a single "ground truth" lattice file, where LatticeJSON is used as intermediate representation.

LatticeJSON does not provide any variables or syntax to reverse or multiply sequence of elements, because it is intended to be generated by a tool. It can be thought of as a (flattened/evaluated) lattice files.  

LatticeJSON tries to provides an intermediate repres restricted versions of common lattice file formats. JSON is able to describe complex data structures,has a human readable syntax and is available in all common programming language. It is therefore an appropriate choice to characterize the magnetic lattice of a particle accelerator.

## Specification

This repository contains the
[Specification of LatticeJSON](https://github.com/andreasfelix/latticejson/blob/master/latticejson/schema.json)
in form of a [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org).

## Example

A LatticeJSON file for a FODO lattice:

```json
{
  "version": "2.2",
  "title": "FODO Lattice",
  "info": "This is the simplest possible strong focusing lattice.",
  "root": "ring",
  "elements": {
    "d1": ["Drift", {"length": 0.55}],
    "q1": ["Quadrupole", {"length": 0.2, "k1": 1.2}],
    "q2": ["Quadrupole", {"length": 0.4, "k1": -1.2}],
    "b1": ["Dipole", {"length": 1.5, "angle": 0.392701, "e1": 0.1963505, "e2": 0.1963505}]
  },
  "lattices": {
    "cell": ["q1", "d1", "b1", "d1", "q2", "d1", "b1", "d1", "q1"],
    "ring": ["cell", "cell", "cell", "cell", "cell", "cell", "cell", "cell"]
  }
}

```

## LatticeJSON CLI

[![Python Version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/latticejson)](https://pypi.org/project/latticejson/)
[![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/latticejson.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/latticejson/)
[![CI](https://github.com/andreasfelix/latticejson/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/andreasfelix/latticejson/actions?query=workflow%3ACI)

This repository also contains a Python based command-line tool which is able validate
and convert LatticeJSON files into other common lattice file formats and vice versa.

You can install and update it using pip or pipenv:

```sh
pip install -U latticejson
```

Validate a LatticeJSON file:

```sh
latticejson validate /path/to/lattice.json
```

Convert an elegant lattice file to the LatticeJSON format:

```sh
latticejson convert --to json /path/to/lattice.lte
```

Autoformat one or more LatticeJSON files:

```sh
latticejson autoformat /path/to/lattice.json ...
```

To activate Bash completion add

```sh
eval "$(_LATTICEJSON_COMPLETE=source latticejson)"
```

to your `.bashrc`. Or, create an activation script with:

```sh
_LATTICEJSON_COMPLETE=source latticejson > latticejson-complete.sh
```
